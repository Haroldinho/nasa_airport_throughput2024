This is the place where I will start the Exploratory Data Analysis for the project

## Objective
The objective of the explorative data analysis is to understand what data was provided and what portion of 
the available data would be the most useful to predict throughput

## Tasks
Understand:
- The structure of the database, the size of the data and the file naming convention
- The mapping between the target variable (throughput) and all the dependent variables, 
mostly through correlation, confusion matrics and independence studies
- The important dimensions and groups to consider through dimensionality reduction, clustering and factorization

Suggest other type of data that could be valuable

## Visualization
This is also the opportunity to start sharing the results of the analysis with stakeholders
